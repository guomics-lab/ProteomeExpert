# ProteomeExpert-Overview

The rapid progresses of high throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics such as data-independent acquisition (DIA) and its penetration to clinical studies have generated increasing number of proteomic data sets containing 100s-1000s samples. To analyze these big proteomic data sets more efficiently and conveniently, we present a web server-based software tool ProteomeExpert implemented in Docker, which offers various analysis tools for experimental design, data mining, interpretation, and visualization of big proteomic data set. ProteomeExpert can be deployed on an operating system with Docker installed.
Availability: The Docker image of ProteomeExpert is freely available from https://hub.docker.com/r/lifeinfo/proteomeexpert. The source code of ProteomeExpert is also openly accessible at http://www.github.com/lifeinfo/ProteomeExpert/.
