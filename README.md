# Development Guide

Although ProteomeExpert web-interface can handle quite a few data and analysis tasks, you may prefer to write your own R-code. ProteomeExpert provides a bridge to programming in R(studio) by exporting the functions used for analysis (i.e., you can conduct your analysis using the ProteomeExpert web-interface or by calling ProteomeExpert's functions directly from R-code). For more information about programming with ProteomeExpert see the [programming](https://github.com/lifeinfo/proteomeExpert) page on the documentation site.
